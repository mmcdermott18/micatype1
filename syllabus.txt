Project 1 (letters) - Black Shapes and White Shapes
	Modes: Cut Paper & Digital
	Materials: Black Paper, White Paper, Scissors, Glue Stick
	Description: Letters can be broken down in to two different parts, black shapes and white shapes.
		Part One - On a piece of 24x18 white paper make an even 6x4 grid. Cut a black shape out that comes close to filling one of the squares of the grid and glue it down. Then cut out two white shapes that will make your e. Follow this process to make 24 e's to fill your grid. Repeat this on another sheet of 24x18, for a total of 48 e's. Don't over think the process of creating the e's. Work quickly and instinctively, The e's should be expressive and experimental not copies of what you think a good e should be.
		Part Two - Pick an e from your grid. On an 11x17 sheet of paper, repeat the same process you used to make that e and write your name. The new letters from your name should use the forms of the e as the guide. Also consider the spacing between the letters while you are creating your name.
		Part Three - Scan your name and trace it in Illustrator using the pen tool. Once it is outlined adjust the shapes as necessary to fit with each other better. Print it out at the same scale as your paper letter name.
