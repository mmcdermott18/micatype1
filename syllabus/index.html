                <h3>course description</h3>
                <p>Typography is the art of organizing letters in space and time. Students gain a familiarity with typographic terms and technologies, an understanding of classical and contemporary typographic forms, an ability to construct typographic compositions and systems, and an appreciation of typography as an expressive medium that conveys aesthetic, emotional and intellectual meaning. Students are introduced to digital typesetting and page layout software. Prerequisite: FF 100 (Elements of Visual Thinking) and FF 199 (Drawing 2).</p>
                <h3>learning outcomes</h3>

                    <li>Demonstrate a clear understanding of how design principles (such as compositional order, tension, scale, contrast, alignment, figure / ground) apply to typography.</li>
                    <li>Distinguish between well designed and poorly crafted typefaces.</li>
                    <li>Develop proficiency in digital typesetting (InDesign).</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>overview</h3>
                <p>Type is everywhere. The only way to avoid it is to close your eyes and even then you still might see it. During this class we will start by looking at the form and structure of letters and then combine those letters to make words, sentences and paragraphs. We will make type by hand, print type digitally and physically, and set type to be viewed on screen. We will learn that the style, weight, size, and color of the type we choose can say just as much as the words we write with it. We will also have various exercises and demos during class to improve your skills and knowledge of the tools available to you. Finally we will talk about the anatomy of type, the history of type, and the type designers who create the type. By the end of the class you will have a strong basis in the fundamentals of typography to use in your evolving design practice.</p>
                <h3>attendance and participation</h3>
                <p>You must be physically, mentally and verbally present and prepared. Punctuality is of prime importance. There are few good excuses for being late to class, try and be as early as you can. Please come to class prepared and ready to work for the entire scheduled time. You are expected to attend all meetings of each class as described in the MICA schedule of classes.  Unexcused absences from as few as four classes will result in a failing grade.</p>
                <h3>discussion of work</h3>
                <p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to talk about your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at MICA. Use this class to improve on those skills too.</p>
                <h3>grading</h3>
                <p>Your grade will depend on your attendance (20%), your participation(15%), your craft(15%), your process (25%), and the completion of all the projects by the end of the class (25%). Below is a more specific breakdown.</p>
                <p>A - Strong design process, ability to come up with many different ways to solve a problem, excellent research, mastery of form, functionality, and craftsmanship, frequent participation in critiques and discussions, strong work ethic, focused, energetic, ability to articulate ideas, resourceful.</p>
                <p>B - Solid, well-done work, could improve on items noted in A list, in particular, better process, more solutions, better craft and attention to detail, more class participation.</p>
                <p>C - Does average work, fulfills assignments but not much else, frequently late, little or no class participation, not willing to re-work or refine projects.</p>
                <p>D - Limited effort, incomplete work, lack of skill and enthusiasm, chronic tardiness and unexcused absences.</p>
                <h3>americans with disabilities act</h3>
                <p>Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Learning Resource Center at 410-225-2416, in Bunting 458, to establish eligibility and coordinate reasonable accommodations.</p>
                <h3>environmental health and safety (ehs)</h3>
                <p>Students are responsible to follow health and safety guidelines relevant to their individual activities, processes, and to review MICA’s Emergency Action Plan and attend EHS training.  Students are required to purchase personal protection equipment appropriate for their major or class.  Those students who do not have the proper personal protection equipment will not be permitted to attend class until safe measures and personal protection are in place.</p>
                <h3>title ix notification</h3>
                <p>Maryland Institute College of Art seeks to provide an educational environment based on mutual respect that is free from discrimination and harassment.  If you have encountered sexual harassment/misconduct/assault, please know that there are multiple ways to report it and you are encouraged to do so (www.mica.edu/equal_opportunity).  Additionally, in order to meet our commitments to equity and to comply with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and guidance from the Office for Civil Rights, faculty and staff members are required to report disclosures of sexual violence made to them by students, except when prior notice regarding a specific classroom assignment or discussion is provided.  If you require academic accommodations due to an incident involving sexual harassment or discrimination, please contact Student Affairs at 410.225.2422 or Human Resources at 410.225.2363.</p>
                <h3>plagiarism</h3>
                <p>Each discipline within the arts has specific and appropriate means for students to cite or acknowledge sources and the ideas and material of others used in their own work.  Students have the responsibility to become familiar with such processes and to carefully follow their use in developing original work.</p> 
                <h4>policy</h4>
                <p>MICA will not tolerate plagiarism, which is defined as claiming authorship of, or using someone else’s ideas or work without proper acknowledgment.  Without proper attribution, a student may NOT replicate another’s work, paraphrase another’s ideas, or appropriate images in a manner that violates the specific rules against plagiarism in the student’s department.  In addition, students may not submit the same work for credit in more than one course without the explicit approval of all of the instructors of the courses involved.</p>
                <h4>consequences</h4>
                <p>When an instructor has evidence that a student has plagiarized work submitted for course credit, the instructor will confront the student and impose penalties that may include failing the course.  In the case of a serious violation or repeated infractions from the same student, the instructor will report the infractions to the department chair or program director.  Depending on the circumstances of the case, the department chair or program director may then report the student to the appropriate dean or provost, who may choose to impose further penalties, including expulsion.</p>
                <h4>appeal process</h4>
                <p>Students who are penalized by an instructor or department for committing plagiarism have the right to appeal the charge and penalties that ensue.  Within three weeks of institutional action, the student must submit a letter of appeal to the department chairperson or program director, or relevant dean or provost related to the course for which actions were taken.  The academic officer will assign three members of the relevant department/division to serve on a review panel.  The panel will meet with the student and the instructor of record and will review all relevant and available materials.  The panel will determine whether or not to confirm the charge and penalties.  The findings of the panel are final.  The panel will notify the instructor, the chairperson, division, the student, and the Office of Academic Affairs of their findings and any recommendations for change in penalties.</p>
                <h3>students with extended illness or cause for legitimate absence</h3>
                <p>In the case of extended illness or other absences that may keep the student from attending a class for more than three meetings, undergraduate students must contact the Student Development Specialist in the Division of Student Affairs.  The Student Development Specialist will then work with the student to determine the cause and appropriateness of the absences and subsequently notify instructors as necessary.  Graduate students must contact the instructor, program director, and the Office of Graduate Studies. Students in art education or professional studies programs must contact the Dean for the Center for Art Education or the Associate Dean for Open Studies, respectively.  The appropriate administrator will facilitate a conversation with relevant faculty to determine whether the student can achieve satisfactory academic progress, which is ultimately at the sole discretion of the faculty member.</p>
